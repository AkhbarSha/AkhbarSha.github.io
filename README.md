# My Projects

This repository contains three projects that I've been working on:

## Wordle Game

The Wordle Game is a popular word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six or fewer tries. In this project, I've built a simple version of the game using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that's easy to learn but challenging to master. In this project, I've created a simple version of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Interactive Photo Album

The Interactive Photo Album is a web-based application that allows users to view and interact with photos in a dynamic and engaging way. In this project, I've built an interactive photo album through image processing tools.

Each project is contained in its own folder within this repository, and each folder includes its own README file with more detailed information about the project and how to run it.

Feel free to explore each project and let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
